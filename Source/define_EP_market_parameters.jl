# define_EP_market_parameters.jl — End-product market and fixed demand profile
# ==============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Initialize the end-product coordination "market": name, initial price,
#   rho_initial, and the fixed demand profile D_EP[jh, jd, jy]. The profile is
#   built from Total_Demand and the normalized column Demand_Column (e.g.
#   LOAD_EP) in the time series: at each (jh, jd, jy) the demand is
#   Total_Demand * profile_value, so the demand is inelastic and shaped by the
#   profile. The ADMM imbalance for EP is (sum of offtaker supplies) - D_EP.
#
# ARGUMENTS:
#   market, data, ts, repr_days — data contains Demand_Column, Total_Demand,
#     initial_price, rho_initial; ts and repr_days are used to build the 3D grid.
